# Thoughtcrime

Ok, this is a repo about my writing mainly about my studies in software engineering including some notes on source codes, papers and course lectures.

The reason why this repo is called thoughtcrime because i just want to call it this way with some potiential inference that I may be too bad to organize my notes or simply that the content is just so close to the minority. Anyway, It's always a pleasure to take minutes on something. So Here it is.
