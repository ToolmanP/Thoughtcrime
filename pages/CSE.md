## Inode-FS
	- Layers
		- Block Layer:
			- 4KB Size per block (maybe but adjustable)
			- Contains bitmap to track the usability of the block
			  id:: 654f666b-a243-49f6-8077-f1324f3092b4
		- File Layer:
			- **Representative**: Inode
			- Resides in the block too. Holds the location where real data stores and the file's metadata.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1699702663883_0.png)
			- Indirect holds another map to block which holds other indirect blocks
			- Only the direct block holds the real data block which stores the actual data
		- Inode number layer
			- Just an array stores behind the block bitmap's with also inode's bitmap
			- Indicates the block number of the inode layer
		- File Name Layer
			- Hide metadata of file management
			- Separate the directory type and regular file type
			- Holds the mapping from the filename to the inode number.
		- Path Name Layer
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1699703268122_0.png)
			- Recursively look up the directory inode untils it lands on the regular files.
			- The inode number of the root directory is fixed. In the case of the ext4, it's assigned with 1. Note that we don't have number 0 here, since it represents the dysfunction of the file system.
	- ### Links
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1699790498209_0.png)
		- Two semantic abstractions
			- LINK (from, to) --- to's name to from's inode
			- UNLINK (name) --- decrease the reference count of the inode where name points to.
		- Create Shortcut from one link to another.
		- We store the reference count inside the inode.
		- We increment the refcnt of the inode if one link is formed. The default is always one.
		- When the reference count of the inode reaches zero, we can safely remove the inode and free the data blocks.
	- #### Renaming(from,to)
		- When renaming, it should be guaranteed that LINK(from, to) is done atomically and should not fail.
	- #### Two Types of lINKS
		- Soft Link --- only associates the destination with the name
		- Hard Link --- associates the destination with the inode number

- ## FAT System
	- **Only Two Layers**
		- File associated entry
			- starting from the root and finds the first block of the backed file and traverse the linked list.
		- Free List
			- contains the free block number and perform allocation and garbage collecting based on this free list.
		- All
