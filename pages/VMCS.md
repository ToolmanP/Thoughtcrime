- **Virtual machine control structure (VMCS)**: is a data structure in memory that exists exactly once per VM (or more precisely one per each VCPU [Virtual CPU]), while the VMM manages it. With every change of the execution context between different VMs, the VMCS is restored for the current VM, defining the state of the VMâ€™s virtual processor and VMM control Guest software using VMCS.

- The VMCS consists of six logical groups:
	- Guest-state area: Processor state saved into the guest state area on VM exits and loaded on VM entries.

	- Host-state area: Processor state loaded from the host state area on VM exits.
	- VM-execution control fields: Fields controlling processor operation in VMX non-root operation.
	- VM-exit control fields: Fields that control VM exits.
	- VM-entry control fields: Fields that control VM entries.
	- VM-exit information fields: Read-only fields to receive information on VM exits describing the cause and the nature of the VM exit.
